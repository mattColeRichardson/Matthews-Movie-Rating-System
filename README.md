# Celeste's portfolio project 1 [Visit Matthew Ricahrdson's Portfolio](http://mattr.codes "Visit my portfolio here")
Hi this project is a playground for me to learn Node.js, .ejs, and express. I originally designed this project in a LAMP stack and learned a lot. Afterword I wanted to take my knowledge to the next level. So, I decided to go ahead and while I was learning create a CRUD app that had a good fit on my resume. I added a MIT license, so have fun in my playground. The goal of this project was to teach me a back to front perspective of how node.js works.
